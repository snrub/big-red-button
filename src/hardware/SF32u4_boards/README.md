===========================

This contains support for the following SparkFun 32u4 based Arduino-compatible development boards:
* [ProMicro 5V](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11098)
* [ProMicro 3.3V](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10999)
* [LilyPadUSB](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11190)

To add this support to your Arduino IDE, simply copy this folder into your hardware directory in one of two
places:
* the actual Arduino directory
* inside your Sketchbook directory
* **Please note: This will only work under Arduino IDE versions 1.0.1 - 1.0.5**

For version 1.5.2, please see the [Arduino repository](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5---3rd-party-Hardware-specification) for more information on adding these files.
Keep in mind that version 1.5.2 is still currently a beta IDE. 

Information on compiling and programming the bootloader can be found in the bootloader directory.
