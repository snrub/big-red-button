==============

An arduino powered, wifi-enabled Big Red Button. You press the button, it sends a payload to a user-defined webservice. From there, the possibilities are endless!

# Components

   * An Arduino
      * I used the [3.3v Pro Micro from sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12587), but any arduino would be fine.
   * Networking
   * Power
   * Button, enclosure etc
